## Single Product Bet: **SMS-kosten transparantie-assistent** — 24/35 (business), Tech Feasibility **8/10**
**Confidence:** 0.54

### Rationale
- Latest validated winner remains: **SMS-kosten transparantie-assistent** — 24/35 (business), Tech Feasibility **8/10**.
- Trend repetition count (last 10): 0.
- Operational reliability context: success30=83.3, fallback30=8.3.
- Recommendation favors a narrow MVP with single painful workflow and payment trigger.

### Kill Criteria
- If <10 qualified users complete core flow in 14 days, stop.
- If no clear willingness-to-pay signal (>=3 paid pilots/LOIs) in 21 days, stop.
- If support burden exceeds target (manual ops >2h/day) by week 3, pivot.
